The Sega Genesis/Mega Drive was not only a powerful console, but also a versatile one. Sega developed several add-ons and peripherals to enhance its capabilities and expand its library of games. Some of the most notable ones were:
 
- The Power Base Converter: This device allowed the Genesis/Mega Drive to play games from its predecessor, the Master System. It plugged into the cartridge slot and had its own slot for Master System games. It also had a port for Master System accessories like the 3D glasses and the light gun.
- The Sega CD: This add-on was a CD-ROM drive that attached to the side of the Genesis/Mega Drive. It enabled the console to play games on CD format, which had more storage space and better sound quality than cartridges. The Sega CD also had its own CPU and RAM, which improved the performance of some games. The Sega CD had a library of over 200 games, including some exclusive titles like Sonic CD, Lunar: The Silver Star, and Snatcher.
- The 32X: This add-on was a 32-bit upgrade that plugged into the cartridge slot of the Genesis/Mega Drive. It had its own CPU, GPU, and RAM, which enhanced the graphics and sound of some games. The 32X also had its own cartridge slot and could play games on both 32X and Genesis/Mega Drive formats. The 32X had a library of over 40 games, including some exclusive titles like Knuckles' Chaotix, Star Wars Arcade, and Virtua Fighter.

These add-ons and peripherals made the Genesis/Mega Drive one of the most advanced and diverse consoles of its time. However, they also had some drawbacks, such as high cost, compatibility issues, power consumption, and market confusion. Some gamers and critics felt that Sega was spreading itself too thin and losing focus on its core console. As a result, many of these add-ons and peripherals did not sell well and were discontinued by Sega in the mid-1990s.
